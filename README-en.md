### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity ^0.8.28 | Core contract language with latest security features |
| **Development Framework** | Hardhat + TypeScript | Type-safe development environment |
| **Security** | OpenZeppelin ^5.4.0 | Battle-tested security patterns |

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Implemented Security Measures

```solidity
// Example: Reentrancy Protection
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _status = _ENTERED;
    _;
    _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
}

// Example: Access Control
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(isOwner[msg.sender], "Not authorized owner");
    _;
}
```

**Security Checklist:**
- ✅ **SWC-107**: Reentrancy protection implemented
- ✅ **SWC-115**: tx.origin authorization avoided  
- ✅ **SWC-101**: Integer overflow protection (Solidity 0.8+)
- ✅ **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- ✅ **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for critical issues
